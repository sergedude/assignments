            <p>HOUSTON, July 20 - Two men landed on the moon today and for more than two hours walked its forbidding surface in mankind’s first exploration of an alien world.</p>

            <p>In the most incredible adventure in human history, these men coolly established earth’s first outpost in the universe, sending back an amazing panorama of views to millions of awed TV viewers.</p>
                    
            <p>With his camera recording the fantastic, totally unreal scene for his home planet, Apollo 11 commander Neil Armstrong climbed down a nine-rung ladder from the cabin of the landing craft called Eagle, and became the first man to step on the moon. It was 10:56 p.m., New York time.</p>
